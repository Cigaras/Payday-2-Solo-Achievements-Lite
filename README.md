[Payday 2](http://store.steampowered.com/app/218620/PAYDAY_2/) [BLT](https://github.com/JamesWilko/Payday-2-BLT) mod that allows to solo some achievements and trophies that require more than one human player.

Only works in Offline mode as requested by the site staff.

* Original Heisters
* Reputation Beyond Reproach

For achievements that required 4 different masks, this number now scales with number of players - for solo play 1 mask is required, for 2 players 2 different masks, for 3 players 3 and so on. Bots do not count. Achievements affected:
* Reindeer Games
* Ghost Riders
* Funding Father
* Four Monkeys
